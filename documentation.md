### Max Hortifruti Shop Project | Documentation

<p>The Max Hortifruti Shop is an authorial project made in React.js, using techs such as i18next for translation and Tailwind CSS for stilization. This project was made based on a design on Figma and the entire project was idealized by its author.</p>

<p>The project works as a webpage that simulates a shop that sells fruits and vegetables. The Max Shop counts with a language and a theme switchers. On the page, the user can see all the items that they can buy and some infortmations about these items, like name, cost and available units that they can buy.
